## Garden Boxes!!!!

This program takes in a user's garden box size, then lets them pick from a list of plants and tell them how many of that chosen plant they would be able to plant in their garden box.

The plant information, types and yields, are stored in a database (which is the gardenbox.sqlite file in this repo)


## To run

You will need to install Ruby's sqlite3 gem in order for the progam to run.

## Future possible changes

I would like to try adding functionality so the user could insert/add vegetables/yields to the database.

Admittedly, I don't know how to work this out, but could be fun to try and get a box with more than one kind of vegetable.
